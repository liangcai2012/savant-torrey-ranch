- USAGE

The python script 'evaluate.py' is composed to estimate the time and space cost of getting (as in 'fetch_attick.py') all the symbol / date trading data in the 'company' table of the generated 'savant.db'. To run the script, type the line 'python evaluate.py <percent>', where percent could be any float number in [0.0 - 100.0], which indicates how big one step in percentage is when walking the whole table by descending order the 'prev_volume' column. The expected result would be like:

Time / Space Cost Measurement for 20.0% step sampling
40 S
2863 K
Time / Space Cost Calculation for whole table with 1045.2 scaling
11H 36M 48S
2G 874M 279K

Where the top section has the observation of real cost by the given percenatge parameter, and the bottom one has the estimation after a corresponding scaling.

The idea is to assume that each row in the table has the same chance to be sampled, and then a walking through the evenly-distributed ordered rows would represent a sampling of the table.

- DEPENDENCY

A. Generate 'savant.db' in data folder by running 'populate_company.py';
B. 'ant' rebuild 'fetcher' folder b/c the 'ATTickDataFetcher.java' was changed to support a few functions.

- USAGE

The python script 'evaluate.py' is composed to estimate the time and space cost of getting (as in 'fetch_attick.py') all the symbol / date trading data in the 'company' table of the generated 'savant.db'. To run the script, type the line 'python evaluate.py <count>', where count could be any interger in [ 1 - ROW_COUNT ], which indicates how many parts the whole table rows (order by descending order of column 'prev_volume') would be equally partitioned. The expected result would be like:

Time / Space Cost Measurement for 10 sampling
52S
1M 656K
Time / Space Cost Calculation for whole table with 522.6 scaling
7H 32M 55S
857M 400K

Where the top section has the observation of real cost by the given count parameter, and the bottom one has the estimation after a corresponding scaling.

The idea is to assume that each row in the table has the same chance to be sampled, and a walking through the ordered rows sampling the middle row of each equally sized partition would form a pool to represent the whoe table.

- DEPENDENCY

A. Generate 'savant.db' in data folder by running 'populate_company.py';
B. 'ant' rebuild 'fetcher' folder b/c the 'ATTickDataFetcher.java' was changed to support a few functions.

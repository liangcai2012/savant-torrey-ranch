This directory contains a simple test code for JSON-based RPC between a Java server and a python client. You will need JSON-RPC 2.0 (Java package), JSON-Smart and JSON-RPC (python package) to run this code. Build java code and external archives (JSON-RPC 2.0 and JSON-Smart) in an IDE and run the application, and then run the python code from command line. You should see the JSON request and response on the IDE console.

To build the code, first you need to create a java project to build the java
code (I use Eclipse). This is adapted from the example of atapi java sdk. you
 need to download the atapi java sdk and include them in your build path.
Export the jar file to your java class path. Then, Download and install
jpype. You should be able to run the python file. Use the following command:

python atshow_jpype.py MSFT 20141112

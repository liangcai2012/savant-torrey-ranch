README

This is a simple guidance of how to run the code. 

1) Dependency:
You need to have a command line environment such as Linux, MacOS or Cygwin. Windows command line is not tested.

You need to install the following software:
1) python (2.7 preferred)
2) Java (JDK 1.7 or above preferred)
3) ant (optional, this is for building java projects. If you dont use ant, then you might want to create java projects through an IDE such as eclipse or javabean) Install ant is very straightforward. See instruction from apache ant project page. 

2) Directory structure:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
|	git_dir (savant-torrey-ranch)
|	       savant 
|	            fetcher     (history data fetcher component: java)
|	                  src
|	            Streamer    (real time streamer component: java)
|	                  src
|	                  old   (older version of streamer)
|	            viewer      (viewer component: python)
|	            controller  (controller: python)
|	            trigger     (trigger: python)
|	            strategy    (strategy worker: python)
|               scraper 	  
|	            meta        (meta database fetcher)
|	            db		  (define database model)
|	            config 	  (global configuration component: python )
|               log		  (global logging component: python)
|	           data:     all data file: sqlite database, history data 
|	
|	       doc:   code documentation, how to build, lib dependency etc. 
|	       spec:  message specification, database schema, file formate etc.
|	       lib: all java code dependent lib 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The configure file is under config. Currently fetcher use this component to setup some execution parameters such as data output. By default the data is sent to home_dir/savant/data/
 
Contents in the data folder should not be tracked by git. The folder is created when you clone the code just for your convenience. If you use the default configuration, the fetcher will output data to this folder.  

3) Java components

Fetcher and Streamer are Java components. To run them , change to the component dir and run 
$ant
$ant run

There are a few other ant commands supported, such as clean and jar, but you don't have to use them. 

4) Python components

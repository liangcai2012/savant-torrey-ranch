Instructions:
1. Wherever x, y or z appears, it means a parameter needs to be specified. If it is followed by [v1, v2,...], v1, v2 means possible values 
2. Correlate means plotting the relationship of two attributes. For example, a sequence of data A has two attributes a1 and a2, plot A in a axis of a1 and a2. If the dots becomes a line, then it is a linear relationship. If the dots are in clusters, then there exist a simple classification mechanism. If the dots are randomly distributed, then a1 and a2 are not strongly correlated.  


strategy 1 (spike 1):
1.1 correlate IPOscoop rating and the ratio of open price/final price of each IPO 
1.2 for each IPO open with a price x percentage higher than final pricing, obtain the high price of the first y[2, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180] seconds and its time. We expect that for all hot IPOs (x > a certain value), the high price is at least 2-5% higher than the open price. Obtain all IPOs that do not satisfy this

1.3 correlate results from 1.2 with lead underwriters. for IPOs that have mulitple lead underwriters, plot one dot for each ipo/underwrite pair
1.4 extend 1.3 to all underwriters
1.5 for each IPO obtain the initial volume, correlate it with results of 1.2
1.6 correlate results of 1.2 with offered shares
1.7 correlate results of 1.2 with market cap (based on final price)
1.8 correlate results of 1.2 with yahoo industry/sector
1.9 extend 1.8 to Google sector/industry

1.10 for each IPO obtain the low price of the first y[2, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180] seconds and its time
